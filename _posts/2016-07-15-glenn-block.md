## Hypermedia Mythbusters
 
The emergence of Hypermedia systems has brought with it a bunch of "facts". Some of the things you might hear are:

- The web was built for Hypermedia. 
- There is no REST without Hypermedia
- Hypermedia is the magic cure for all of your API ills. 
- With Hypermedia your API is guaranteed to be robust.

Some of what you hear is true and some, well, they are just urban legends.

Join this episode of Hypermedia Mythbusters and we'll separate fact from fiction.
