APIs are a new and incredibly powerful mechanism to rapidly deliver value to customers leveraging DevOps approaches and sophisticated tools.

This talk will focus on how to approach the cases where you don't have this luxury and you need to integrate back into a legacy SOA environment. We will cover what are the most appropriate techniques and patterns for bridging the gap between and API centric approach and a legacy SOA environment based on our recent experience with a large government client.
