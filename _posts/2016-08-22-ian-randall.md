## API's at Pushpay - A Continuous Delivery Story.
  
At Pushpay - having an API is critical to our long term go to market strategy. We push changes to production half-a-dozen times a day or more. We do this with an expanding engineering team in an industry that demands rigour and risk aversion.  Join me as I talk about how we ship a feature all the way from a thought in someone's head to running on the production servers. Sometimes, on the same day!  This session will cover the tools and systems that make this possible, but more importantly the organisational culture that is the bedrock on which those systems are implemented.
