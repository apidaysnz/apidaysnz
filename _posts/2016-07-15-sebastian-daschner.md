## Putting Hypermedia Back in REST with JAX-RS and Java EE
 
Everybody is doing REST -- at least everybody claims they are. But mostly web APIs are built without Hypermedia, what would allow the client to follow related resources and autonomously navigate through the API without prior implicit logic of the application. For developing enterprise application in the Java ecosystem, JAX-RS offers an easy integration of web services. This sessions shows the concept and benefits of a Hypermedia driven REST API using Siren as a Hypermedia-enabled content type and how to implement this using JavaEE 7 with JAX-RS.
