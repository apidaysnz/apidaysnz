The API Days NZ venue and date have been confirmed! We will be running the conference at the Viaduct Events Centre in central Auckland on the 6th and 7th of October.

Due to the success of last years event, this years will be run over two days. We are hoping to hear many more local stories about real implementations this year so please let us know if you would like to be a speaker!

ANZ Viaduct Events Centre, located on Auckland’s vibrant waterfront, is a premium venue with stunning spaces.

The ANZ Viaduct Events Centre takes pride of place in Auckland's reinvigorated Wynyard Quarter. Restaurants, cafes and public spaces have combined to create a beautiful waterfront walk enjoyed by both locals and visitors. The venue is just a few minutes’ walk from the city centre where a wide-range of accommodation is available.

The venue been praised for its location and design, and also for the technical facilities and well run functions.

A great spot for API Days!
