## Distributed workflows with hypermedia clients
 
Hypergoal, workflow in a hypermedia world

Traditional workflow systems rely on server orchestration with a centralized server that manages all of the work and the state necessary to complete the workflow. 

In a hypermedia world however we really want the client to drive, not the server. Hypermedia is all about offering choices. The client has a goal it wants to achieve. Hypermedia provides a way for the client to achieve that goal is it navigates hypermedia controls to achieve its final state. 

Sound intriguing? In this session, we'll learn about Hypergoal, a "work in progress" effort that aims to make this possible through introducing client driven workflows.
