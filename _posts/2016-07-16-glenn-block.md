## Distributed workflows with hypermedia clients
 
Glenn will demonstrate a goal oriented hypermedia workflow.

A system which enables hypermedia clients to express a goal which the server directs them to achieve. This differs from traditional clients in which the server(s) generally do not have the context of what the client is trying to do.
