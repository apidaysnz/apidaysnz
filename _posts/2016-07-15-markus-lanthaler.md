## From Strings to Things to a Web of Services
 
The Web is undergoing a fundamental change from strings and keywords to structured data and things. More than 25% of all websites already contain structured information. Initiatives such as Schema.org allow search engines to extract and understand such data, integrate it, and create knowledge graphs to improve their services.
 
This keynote will give you a different perspective on Web APIs and introduce you to Linked Data, JSON-LD, and Hydra. It will show you how to build Hypermedia APIs on steroids and prepare you for the next evolution of the Web.
