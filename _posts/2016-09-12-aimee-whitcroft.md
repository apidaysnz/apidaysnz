## Open Data and APIs: fueling innovation
  
Open data is an increasingly common topic around business, government and civil society circles. And one of the best ways to serve open data out is through APIs.

I'll talk about the use of open data and APIs in events like GovHack (Australasia's largest open data/open govt hackathon), and why these events - and open data - are key to New Zealand's success as a society.

## Bio:
 
I'm an open data / open government / civic technology advocate working in the online/digital, engagement and service delivery spaces in local and central Government. I'm also 2IC/comms lead for GovHack NZ 2016.
