## Speaker Information...

### Theme: Unifying Digital Business

APIs enable new ways to connect, collaborate and to do business.

In the new era of cloud computing and everything “as a service”, APIs define the syntax and semantics of collaboration, they provide the physical endpoint and they provide the point of control.

APIs help unify many of the ways we do business. APIs bridge the gaps between technology and business value, they bring together disparate parts of a business community or ecosystem to operate and collaborate as a unified whole. APIs help unify development and operations. 

So at APIdays New Zealand let us all -  technologists, entrepreneurs and business thought-leaders - get together around the theme of APIs. We invite you to participate as a speaker at APIdays New Zealand, to share your thoughts and ideas with your peers, to demonstrate thought-leadership and to help us grow the local API community.

### Topics

APIdays New Zealand is a two-day, two-track conference with one track focused on business and strategy, while the other track deals with technology and implementation. Your audience will represent a range of experience from seasoned API veterans to people who are just embarking on their API journey. So we encourage talks for beginners as well as advanced topics. Talk duration is 30 minutes including questions.

We welcome all applications that are relevant to APIs, but to give you some ideas of areas of interest we are keen to explore in the “strategy” stream include:

+ Banking and FinTech - Banking APIs, Blockchain as a platform for asset transfer.
+ HealthTech - Connected Healthcare, Personal Health Management.
+ Smart Homes and Smart Cities - Connected Homes, Devices, Smart-Grids.
+ Democracy & Government - Open Government, Open Data, Connected Government Services
+ The API Economy
+ The Business Case for APIs
+ Company Case Studies and Experience
+ New Digital Business Models
+ API Marketing and Community Engagement
+ Monetization, Subscription & Billing
+ Identity, security and privacy
+ The Composable Enterprise

And some suggestions for the “execution” stream dealing with technology and implementation:

+ API Security
+ API Design
+ API Specification – Open API Initiative, RAML, API Blueprint etc.
+ API Consumption
+ API Testing
+ Hypermedia - HAL, Siren, JSON-LD, HYDRA
+ Internet of Things
+ Managing Change - API Lifecycle Management
+ Back-end Architecture
+ Microservices, containers and serverless architectures
+ Mobile Development
+ Reactive and Asynchronous APIs
+ Monitoring & Analytics
+ Platforms as a Service (PaaS and iPaaS)

All Speakers must adhere to the Conference Code of Conduct.

### Location
APIdays this year will be held at the Viaduct Events Centre in Auckland. Based on the success of previous events we are planning for a strong turnout and two streams of talks over two days. This allows for on the order of 32 speakers, so we want to hear your voice.

### Attendance & Speakers Dinner
If you are accepted to speak at APIdays then we will provide you with a free ticket to the conference and to the cocktail party. You will also be invited to the speakers dinner to socialise with your peers.  We ask that you (or your employer) covers the costs for any travel or accommodation required for your attendance.

### Financial Assistance
We recognise that not everyone has financial support from an employer, so if you are self-employed or have no one to cover your costs then APIdays does have limited funds that we can use to help cover or offset travel and accommodation costs that you may incur if we accept your application to speak. 

### Diversity
The IT industry is not yet as culturally diverse as we would like, we want to help address this deficit. When assessing speaker applications and requests for financial assistance we will consider how your participation will help us move toward a more balanced event. 

### Timing
The Call for speakers closes on August 25th and we plan to finalise the program by September 1st. We will however be assessing applications earlier than that in order to build up the momentum around the conference. So there are advantages to get your application in early.
