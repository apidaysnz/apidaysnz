## HL7 FHIR: the API for healthcare

The use of APIs is widespread within the IT industry, they enable data sharing, and foster innovation. However, APIs are new to healthcare IT. In this presentation we will cover how a standardized API can provide real benefits to those involved in the delivery of healthcare - including the healthcare consumer. We will describe HL7 FHIR, the API standard that is attracting enormous interest and truly igniting innovation in global healthcare organisations.

For Orion Health, APIs and FHIR are enabling smarter exchange and acquisition of data, mobility and new types of connected solutions. We are developing API and FHIR expertise among our people, and also guide our customers on their integration and interoperability journey.
FHIR represents a major standards upgrade that will boost access to health information, which will improve the access to a patients health information globally. Learn more at the presentation.
