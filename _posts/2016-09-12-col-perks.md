## API Design Aesthetics
  
APIs, or at least those that claim to follow RESTFulness, are based on an architectural style, not a standard. So, what role would aesthetics play in designing APIs? Can APIs be standardised? Can selecting a cloud service be a matter of API taste? Are there API Michelangelos and Picassos in the API world? In this talk we look at API design as a Style, considering the qualities that might make an API beautiful. And we look at some of those 1960's Carparks of the API world.

## Bio:
 
I practice as an Architect. Over the last 25 years the disciplines of architecture have changed dramatically, perhaps even disappeared. One constant remains. Integration. I love APIs. I was brought up in the twilight of OSI, suffered through the paper-weight of CORBA, became a knight of WS-*, and finally discovered what HTTP could do. I design APIs for my clients.
