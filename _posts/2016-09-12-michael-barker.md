## Reactive & Asynchronous - Adventures with APIs in Financial Trading
  
The financial trading world has had a long history of distributed APIs and protocols. This talk will crack open the lid on a few of these APIs and look at what properties they have allow for them to be used on systems that have sub 100 microsecond mean latency or generate in excess of 10 million messages a second. It will compare them to more contemporary HTTP/REST/JSON/XML-like solution to look at how they differ and how some of the ideas can be adapted to improve the performance and monitorablility of your own APIs.
