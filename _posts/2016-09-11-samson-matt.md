## How to grow a startup on Government API's
  
Amongst the boom of startups all around New Zealand, there is a new breed of startups emerging who are daring to venture into the Govt Tech space. 

Vizbot is a Govt Tech startup showing Local Councils across New Zealand how opening up their APIs can mean the world of difference to their customers "us ratepayers".

At Vizbot they are currently looking at ways to improve the way an applicant (builders, architects, etc.) applies for a building consent here in New Zealand.  They believe the secret is in using APIs. 

They've built a web application that simplifies and streamlines the building consent application process. The web app promises to reduce delays, increase transparency, provide visibility, and brings forth accountability in the building consenting process. 

In their talk, they will take you on their journey of how they have used APIs to grow their startup, and share the good, the bad and the ugly.
