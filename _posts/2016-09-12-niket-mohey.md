## The Rise of the Composable Enterprise
  
With the emergence of cloud, mobile, social media, and IoT, Enterprise IT has never been the same. Not only are technologies such as cloud computing pushing the boundaries of the enterprise, they are also shifting the roles and perspectives of everyone in the organisation. 

Taking advantage of a composable enterprise is the key to support the changing demands of the organisation by assembling and reassembling modular components made up of both technology and people. 

In this session, you will learn how to architect your organisation to thrive in an agile environment, and accomodate new technologies while retaining value from on-premises systems.
