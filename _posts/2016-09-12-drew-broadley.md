## Designing the API's of a P2P Platform
  
Penny is the next P2P due to launch October, with a focus on being API-First. 

This includes hosting server-less HTML/JS front-end that is powered 100% by API's, JWT tokens to enable passing of authorisation, utilising an API-front banking platform from Germany, building a decisioning API from sourcing data from multiple ID and Credit Checking services, building a bank API to wrap around different banks that we interact with while managing an audit log from all the different services.

## Bio:
 
Achieving my personal goals in the service area, and learning how teams work and execute under tremendous pressures, I wanted to learn about building a product company. This started with becoming a finalist at the Grow Wellington Bright Ideas Challenge, awarded business scholarships, winning NZ Innovator awards, acknowledged in the top four under forty to watch, building a company to acquisition, returning to create my next venture of building a high growth company focused on building a great team, investigable culture while raising the money needed.
