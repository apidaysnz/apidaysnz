## Data as a language
 
More details to come!

## Bio:

Lillian brings a new perspective on data, one where data is a language in which everyone can be fluent. She believes societies and individuals will benefit when anyone can use data to inform their thinking and insights without requiring intermediaries. In establishing Figure.NZ in 2012, Lillian took the unique position of designating everyone to be a user of data. She leads the team to build systems and software, and to widely and deeply collaborate throughout New Zealand to deliver to this standard.

Lillian is also on the Data Futures Partnership Working Group, as well as on the board of the NZ Innovation Partnership and of NZ Centre of Research Excellence Te PÅ«naha Matatini. Previously Lillian was at Academy Award-Winning Massive Software, at think tank The New Zealand Institute.
