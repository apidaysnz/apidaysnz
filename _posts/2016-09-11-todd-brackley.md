## Building hypermedia clients
  
A hypermedia client walks a network of data following links - that we all know and are starting to see in practice. It turns out that edit and create forms are used less; hard coding prevails. HAL doesn't have forms for example, yet the lesser used Cj does as templates. I will demonstrate provisioning a network of data through a javascript client to show that there is no magic and talk through some of the major design issues.

## Bio:
 
Todd actively works with startups and corporates to help them build the capability to deliver simple, scalable software the way the web works.
