## JavaScript for APIs
 
Adoption of JavaScript sets the stage for the biggest shift in enterprise application development in more than a decade. - [Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/The+Dawn+Of+Enterprise+JavaScript/fulltext/-/E-RES120686)

This workshop aims to help developers who are competent in other languages and environments become familiar with the JavaScript language and its ecosystem, both client-side and server-side. Many types of applications can be built with JavaScript these days. This workshop focuses on the important aspects of the language and ecosystem when exposing and consuming APIs.

The workshop will be an engaging mix of lecture and instructor-led hands-on coding exercises using the latest version of JavaScript and modern tools and libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem. There will be opportunities to collaborate with others in the workshop and engage in rich conversation about the materials covered.

### Learning Objectives

1. Attendees will become more familiar with:
 * Consuming APIs over HTTP in the context of a web-based application
 * Orientation around JavaScript full stack including node.js 
 * Current state of JavaScript language including ES6
 * JavaScript ecosystem including build tools e.g. Gulp
 * Layered testing in JavaScript and appropriate tools e.g. Jasmine, Sinon, Mocha, Chai
 * Asynchronous JavaScript programming with callbacks and promises
 * Key aspects of the JavaScript language used when working with APIs
2. Attendees will have fun. Fun is mandatory.

### Pre-Requisites

* Experience of a curly bracket language e.g. C, C++, Java, C#
* Your own laptop
* A github account

Come and learn the foundational practices of JavaScript and its ecosystem so you can write code that can be easily understood and maintained over time.
