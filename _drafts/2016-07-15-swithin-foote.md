## APIculate
 
How to start your API strategic journey. 

What are the key components for your journey, including the order and team that should be considered. I developed this talk as a workshop that I have run with several organisations. It is easily adapted to support specific industries but for this talk I would make it generic with one or two industry specific references. It is also 100% technology agnostic as a strategy should be.

## Bio:
