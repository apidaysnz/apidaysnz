## Machine learning your way to smarter API error responses
 
Machine learning is quickly becoming a common place method to handle the grey area of user requests and interaction. From messaging chat apps to even the most basic of online ordering its quickly become a way to gauge user input and attempt to not only respond with a best match response but also add the user interaction to the base pair program. In this talk we are going to look at ways that we can use machine learning to a new level and attempt to handle malformed API requests in a new way and attempt to decipher unmatchable requests in a way that will try and not only respond with a best fit response but capture the user errors for future responses.
