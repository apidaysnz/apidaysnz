## Functions as a service
 
Functions as a service (FaaS) is an emerging pattern to build APIs at scale. You can use various FaaS implementations such as AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions to build APIs ecosystem for your organisation. Stored procedures can be considered as a variation of FaaS. Developing APIs against these stored procedures is generally considered as anti-pattern. But what if you have substantial investment in stored procedures (8-12 years) and most of your business logic is embedded in stored procedures. In this talk we discuss how you can leverage existing stored procedures to create a fast-track API transformation program on top of your legacy systems. Then we discuss how you can break the spell on stored procedures by migrating business logic into a service tier - one StoreProc at a time. We will also cover Isentia's API transformation journey, some key learnings and unavoidable mistakes.
