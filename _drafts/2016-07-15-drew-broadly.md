## Designing the APIs of a P2P Platform
 
Penny is the next P2P due to launch October, with a focus on being API-First. This includes hosting server-less HTML/JS front-end that is powered 100% by API's, JWT tokens to enable passing of authorisation, utilising an API-front banking platform from Germany, building a decisioning API from sourcing data from multiple ID and Credit Checking services, building a bank API to wrap around different banks that we interact with while managing an audit log from all the different services.

## Bio:

Named Hot 4 under 40 to watch, awarded Emerging Innovator in NZ, focusing on the financial technology space, with the last three ventures being payments, accounting and now P2P lending.
